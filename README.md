## Purpose of this repository
Here you can find data & code for the paper on structural properties of libretti in DraCor

## Structure of this repository
* [Data](/data)
* [Code](/code) (relies entirely on the data in the [Data](/data) folder, no external data is needed)
* [Results](/results) in the form of visualizations and tables (these files are linked in the final version of the paper)
* [Paper](giovannini_skorinkin_libretti_2023pp.pdf) draft in the PDF format

## Reproduction of the research: instruction

Run the [notebook](/code/DraCor_Opera_Analyser.ipynb) to reproduce the research. The notebook is optimised for use in Google Colab, but also works as a standalone Jupyter notebook if all the external libraries & their dependencies are installed.
